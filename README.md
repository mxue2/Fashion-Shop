## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

"Fashion Shop App" is a basic online shopping website where users could see a shopping list page with simple design and clear style. All products can be ordered by price and filtered by size. After choosing and clicking on a product, users will be directed into a single product page and get more product information. Also, users could add different number of products to the shopping cart.

## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

- Applied React Hooks to maintain and manipulate state and got more readable and testable code.
- Used React Router and Link for page navigation. Users are allowed to navigate to different pages without refreshing the page, providing a more seamless user experience.
- Made use of Sass for styling, which provides more organized file structure and reusable code. 
- Used media queries to apply different styles for different media devices to achieve Responsive Web Design.
